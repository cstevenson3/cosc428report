\section{Proposed Method}
\subsection{Segmentation}
We aim to find the segments divided by pencil lines.

The sketch is grayed, inverted, and blurred. An adaptive threshold highlights both sides of each pencil mark as black, with the background in white. This is inverted so pencil edges are white against a black background. A closing operation with 2 dilations and 1 erosion of a 5x5 kernel joins the two sides of each pencil mark, giving thick white pencil against a black background. These white edges may contain black pixels within them. This is acceptable as long as the edge has no black path between segments.
